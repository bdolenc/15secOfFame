<h1>15 seconds of fame </h1>

This is Raspberry Pi reimplementation of 15 seconds of fame project by Franc Solina. (http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/129/1/solina_leonardo_04.pdf)
15seconds of fame is an interactive installation that every 15 seconds generates a new pop-art portrait of a randomly selected viewer. The installation
was inspired by Andy Warhol’s ironical statement that “in the future everybody will be famous for 15 minutes.” The installation
detects human faces and crops them from the wide-angle view of people standing before the installation. Pop-art portraits are then 
generated by applying randomly selected filters to a randomly chosen face from the audience. These portraits are then shown in 15-second
intervals on the flat-panel computer monitor, which is framed as a painting.

The reimplementation of the project was part of my final project at subject Interactivity and Information design on master study of CS
FRI UL.
